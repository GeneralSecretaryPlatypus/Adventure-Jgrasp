The game is based off of the atari 2600 game Adventure. The player uses keys to open gates, and tries to get a trophy to the ending room. This isn't complete, the key item isn't working, and I haven't created the gate and trophy yet, beyond the image.

The runnable class is the Adventure class. You should be able to move through the rooms, and sort of interact with the first key. controls are WASD for movement and E to interect with items.
